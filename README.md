A text-based fighting game simulator!

**How does it work?**
There are two opponents: an attacker (that only launches attacks) and a defender (that can only defend against the attacks). 
There's four types of attacks categorized by height: extra-low, low, medium and high. Similar to the attacks there are four types of defenses: extra-low, low, medium and high. If the heights of the attack-defense round match, then the attack is 'blocked'. Otherwise the attack is counted as a 'hit'. 

At the end, the program shows the summary statistics of the match.
